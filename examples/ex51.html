		Jack was a sailor. He lived in England, but he was often away with his ship.
	</p>
	<p>
		One summer he came back from a long voyager and found new neighbours near his mother's house. They had a pretty daughter, and Jack loved her very much.
	</p>
	<p>
		He said to her, 'My next voyage will begin in a few days' time, Gloria. I love you and I'll marry you when I come back. I'll think about you all the time, and I'll write to you and send you a present from every port.'
